# Tax Calculator ðŸ§¾
<p>Created a simple tax calculator that takes some user info such as name, age, income source and salary, then calculates his annual, net and gross income. I have taken in consideration of the Tax Regimes - OLD and New both.<br/>According to that, net income is shown and for saving tax i have suggested the person to use old or new tax regime. I have also compared the net income of old tax regime and new tax regime then code will help you find the percentage of increase or decrese in salary.</p>

## Output:
